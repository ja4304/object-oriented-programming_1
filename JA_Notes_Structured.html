	<h1>World Wide Web</h1>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Made up of HTML Documents</li>
				<li>HTML = HyperText Markup Language</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Major Components:</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>You -- Your Computer -- Internet -- Servers</li>
				<li>Servers communicate using http</li>
			</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h1>HTML</h1>
		<h2>4 Components</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Text Content (what you see)</li>
				<li>Markups (what it looks like)</li>
				<li>References to other docs</li>
				<li>Links to other pages</li>
			</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h1>Structure in HTML</h1>
		<h2>Code should be structured to help with Organization</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b></li>
				<li>HTML has a "tree-like structure" - elements can have other elements inside of them</li>
				<li>Each Element corresponds to a <b>BOX</b> on the webpage</li>
				<li>Programmers indent these elements to correspond with the box</li>
			</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h1>Using CSS to add <em><b>STYLE</b></em></h1>
		<h2>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
		<ul class="points">
			<li>CSS is used to control the style of the corresponding HTML page</li>
			<li>HTML Elements are given class names, and then style is applied to that class</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Avoiding Repetition</h2>
		<ul class="points">
			<li>Using classes to avoid repetition helps to avoid errors</li>
			<li>Using classes also makes it easier to make changes to style in one place</li>
		</ul>

	<h1>Intro to "Serious" Programming</h1>
		<h2>What is Programming</h2>
		<ul class="points">
			<li><b>Programming</b> is the core of computer science</li>
			<li>A computer is a machine that can execute a program</li>
			<li>A program is a specific <b>sequence of steps</b> for the computer to follow without any thought</li>
			<li>Programmers indent these elements to correspond with the box</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Programming Language</h2>
		<ul class="points">
			<li>A programming language is designed to make it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed by a computer</li>
			<li>Programming languages have strict syntax rules. If not followed exactly, the program will not execute.</li>
			<li><b>PYTHON</b> is an example of a programming language.</li>
			<li>Some different elements in Python include Expressions, Variable, Strings, and Numbers</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Variables and Strings</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Variables are useful for storing data to be used in expressions</li>
				<li>Variables can be changed easily without having to change the expressions</li>
				<li>Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes</li>
				<li>Strings can be <b>Indexed</b> so that characters or sub-sequences can be extracted from them</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Input-Functions-Output</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Use Procedures(or <b>Functions</b>) to make repeated tasks easier</li>
				<li>Procedures map inputs to outputs</li>
				<li>A function must have a <b>return</b> statement to provide the output back to where the function was called</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Decisions and Repetition</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Comparison of numbers outputs a <b>Boolean Value</b>(ie: True or False), not a number.</li>
				<li><b>IF Statements</b> can be used with comparisons to make decisions on what code to run.</li>
				<li><b>Loops</b> are a way to do things over and over again.</li>				
			</ul>
		<h2>Debugging Strategies</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>Examine Error Messages</li>
				<li>Work from a working example</li>
				<li>Check intermediate results.  Add print statements in your code to check status</li>
				<li>Keep and compare old versions</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Structured Data: Lists and For Loops</h2>
			<h3>Lists</h3>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>String is a sequence of characters.</li>
				<li><b>List is a sequence of anything.</b></li>
				<li>A <b>Nested Lists</b> are lists within a list</li>
				<li>List can be appended to.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Mutation and Aliasing</h3>
			<ul class="points">
				<li><b>Mutation</b> is the ability to change the value of the elements of a list</li>
				<li>Strings are not mutable.</li>
				<li><b>Aliasing</b> is having different ways to refer to the same object.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>for Loops</h3>
			<ul class="points">
				<li><b>for Loops</b> provide a simple way to cycle through elements in a list.</li>
				
			</ul>

	<h1>Stage 3: Adding Videos to Your Page</h1>
		<h2>Use Functions</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>There are pre-built functions or <b>modules</b> in Python such as <b>webbrowser</b> and <b>time</b></li>
				<li>The idea that the functions are already there, and we don't have to build them is called <b>Abstraction</b></li>
				<li>These functions are contained in <b>The Python Standard Library</b></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
			<ul class="points">
				<li><b>Object Oriented Programming</b> is a method that is organized around objects and data rather than procedures and logic.</li>
				<li>This differs from other views which treat programs as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces and output.</li>
				<li>This approach helps when dealing with large projects because you can break it into pieces(objects) and work in sections.</li>
				<li>One way OOP is similar to HTML is the use of classes.  In HTML, classes can be used to apply styling and formatting to all tags that are marked with that class.  In Python, classes can be used to apply rules and methods to all instances of that class.</li>
				<li>One of the principles of OOP is the concept of <b>Abstraction</b>.  By using abstraction, the programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.  He/she focuses only on the details that are important for his/her purpose.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>When Functions Do Not Suffice - Using Classes</h3>
			<ul class="points">
				<li>A class is like the blue print of a building. It contains some general rules and attributes of the module</li>
				<li>When using a class, you create an <b>Instance</b> or <b>Object</b> that contains the specific details for that use</li>
				<li>A subclass can be defined and related to the initial class. It will inherit the definitions from the class.  This is called <b>Inheritance</b></li>
				<li>An example:  <b>Vehicle</b> could be a parent class. All vehicles would have similar characteristics.  <b>Truck</b> or <b>Car</b> could be <b>subclasses</b>, or <b>child classes</b>, related to the <b>superclass</b>, Vehicles.</li>
				<li>These child classes would inherit some or all of their characteristics from the class(wheels, doors, etc), but could also contain features that are different(body style, # of passengers, etc).</li>
				<li>An <b>Object</b> is a specific instance of a subclass or class.  An example would be a Ford_F150.  It would contain attributes of the Truck subclass, and the Vehicle class.</b>
				<li>Each object can contain procedures that are called <b>methods</b>.  A <b>method</b> in an object can only access the data known to that object, which ensures data integrity among a set of objects.</li>
				<li>From this organization, we can also have <b>Class Variables</b>, which belong to the class as a whole, and <b>Instance Variables</b> which belong to specific objects.</li>
				<li>Calling a class creates space in memory for the instance that did not exist before</li>
				<li>Classes like turtle can create geometric shapes</li>
				<li>There are external Python packages such as <b>twilio</b> that can be used to complete tasks.</li>
				<li>Functions like <b>Open</b> are examples of <b>Built-in Functions</b>.  These are functions that are commonly used and always available.  They are located in the <b>Python Standard Library</b></li>
				<li><b>The Python Standard Library</b> contains built-in modules that provide access to system functionality that is commonly needed.  This resource saves the programmer from having to create solutions for common functions in programming.</li>
